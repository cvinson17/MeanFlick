This isn't done yet, but I finally figured out how exactly the shit i need to mess with works, so I'll finish it tomoorow (Sat)

If ya'll wanna mess with the css to make it look pretty:
public/modules/core/css/styles.css/styles
That's the css file you can mess with for styles

Anything in the public/modules/[module_name]/views you can also mess with as long as you don't delete/change any of the the ng-whatever tags. That's all html with bootstrap css. I have a working file of all those, so anything that is messed up, I can fix no biggie.
